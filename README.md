# 🌦️ Smart Weather & Energy Prediction System

An AI-powered system for predicting weather conditions and improving energy consumption efficiency using Deep Learning models.

This project combines Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and IoT concepts to create a smart environmental monitoring and prediction system.

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

The system analyzes environmental data such as:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Wind Speed
- Energy Usage

Then it:
- Predicts future weather conditions
- Provides smart energy-saving recommendations
- Helps reduce unnecessary power consumption

The project supports two modes:

## 🔹 Manual Input Mode
The user manually enters environmental values.

## 🔹 Sensor Mode (IoT Ready)
Sensors automatically send real-time environmental data to the system.

# 🧠 Models Used

## 1️⃣ Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

MLP is a Deep Learning neural network model used for structured numerical data.

### ✅ Why MLP?
- Learns complex relationships between features
- Works efficiently with tabular datasets
- Suitable for prediction tasks

### 📌 Used For
- Weather prediction
- Environmental data analysis
- Energy consumption recommendations

---

## 2️⃣ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

RNN is designed for handling sequential and time-series data.

### ✅ Why RNN?
Weather data changes over time, so RNN helps the system learn patterns from previous values.

### 📌 Used For
- Time-series forecasting
- Sequential environmental analysis
- Future weather prediction

---

## 3️⃣ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTM is an advanced type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data.

### ✅ Why LSTM?
Weather and environmental data are time-dependent, and LSTM performs better than traditional RNNs in remembering long-term patterns.

### 📌 Used For
- Weather forecasting
- Time-series prediction
- Learning long-term environmental patterns

### ⚡ Features
- Handles long sequences efficiently
- Reduces vanishing gradient problems
- Improves prediction accuracy
